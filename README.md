Twitter-Garden-SL
=================

Scripts that retrieve twitter searches and display them in Second Life through floating text.


This uses 2 parts, a php file on a webserver and LSL code inside of SL. 
This php code is already over 3 years old, and might not be the best or most efficient way to do this.

You will need to put twitter-search.php on a webhost.  


Preparing your SL Object:
To have the floating text appear above your object, you will have to make a object consisting out of 1 or more prims. The child prims you want the floating text to appear at you will have to name "TwitterObject". 
 
Now copy the code from twitter-search.lslp to a script in the root prim of your object. Once there you will have to edit the string url = "http://your.domain.com/folder/"; to your domain name and folder that you have placed twitter-search.php in
