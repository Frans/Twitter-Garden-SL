Twitter-Garden-SL
=================

Scripts that retrieve twitter searches and display them in Second Life through floating text.


This uses 2 parts, a php file on a webserver and LSL code inside of SL. 
This code is already over 3 years old, and might not be the best or most efficient way to do this.
